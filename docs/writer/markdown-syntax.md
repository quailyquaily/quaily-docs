# Markdown Syntax

## Basic Syntax

Quaily uses GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec as the basic syntax for writing posts. Please refer to the [GFM spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/) for more details.

You can also refer to Quaily's basic Markdown tutorial: "[📚 ⏰ 💡 Master the Simplest Markdown Syntax in 5 Minutes](https://quaily.com/blog/p/simplest-markdown-syntax-learn-in-5-minutes)".

## Extended Syntax

Some syntaxes are not supported by GFM, but are supported by Quaily, they are listed below. You can also check out the [live demo](https://quaily.com/blog/p/extended-markdown-syntax)

> Most of extended syntax are currently rendered in the web browser only, and cannot be displayed in Email.

## Notes

### Equations and Formulas

- If you want to write equations and formulas in your post, please make sure you have enabled the MathJax render at the post options.
- inline equations and formulas are not supported yet. Please use the block equation instead.

```
$$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$
```
